- 👋 Hi, I’m @jaopdias
- 👀 I’m interested in C# and Typescript. QA focused on different tests on different layers since unit tests to e2e. Using approaches like xUnit, Jest, Playwright to save time on validations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement unit tests with FakeItEasy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quality since the project beginning
- 📫 How to reach me: joaopaulo.dias@wexinc.com or João Paulo Dias on Google Chat
